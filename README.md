# bad-linktree

my own custom linktree alternative.

## **Table of Contents**

* [**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

* [**Getting started (editing the page)**](#getting-started-editing-the-page)
* [**Getting started (deploying the page)**](#getting-started-deploying-the-page)
* [**Legal/License**](#legallicense)

## Features

Why use this over *literally any other solution*/*your own alternative*?

### Pros

* **No watermark** at the bottom of the page

* **No forced ads** if you don't want to

* **You have full control** over the page by styling your own css, adding your own JS, and even editing the HTML. This is simply a starting point.

* **Nearly zero limitations**: Lets say some specific website TOS doesn't allow `x`, but your whole point revolves around `x` and you want to make it themed like such (and `y` isn't an option)<br>
...Or simply you can't find one with such a permissive license...

### Cons

* **Spaghetti** html and css.

So you should probably create your own.

## Getting started (editing the page)

### Prerequisities for editing

* **A calculator** - Preferably one that can do billions of calculations in a second, but if you have to, feel free to use the [**BBC Micro**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) if you have to.

* **Something to edit files with** - If you're using my favourite distro of the NT kernel, Windows, there is a preinstalled application called **Notepad.exe** (located in the system32 folder) that should work. If you're on ~~GNU/Linux~~ ~~GNU/Linux~~ [Linux](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) based operating systems, you probably already have [**emacs**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs), [**nvim**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Neovim), [**vim**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), [**vi**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) or [**gnu nano**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano) installed. feel free to use that.

### Editing

I don't know. You've come this far, im sure you'll think of something.

## Getting started (deploying the page)

There is no backend (so you *probably* don't need to use docker). As long as you know how to set up a frontend page, then you're all set.

### Prerequisities for deploying

* **A calculator** - One of those modern calculators that can do billions of calculations in a second, chances are, you already have one right now, infront of you.

* **Git** - To download the repo, but you can always click on **Code > Download ZIP**

* **Something to deploy the HTML page to** - I'm not a server admin I don't know lol.

### Deploying

so basically, you'll want to download the entire site.

> **Note**:
> This is the cli download lol

```bash
git clone https://github.com/williamanimate/bad-linktree bad-linktree
cd bad-linktree
```

After that, all you need to do is start the server. I am no server admin though, so i have no clue how to do that.

<details>
<summary>but what if i do want a backend?</summary>

**Then make a pull request or something so I can add it**. Not sure why you would want a backend for this though. It only makes life harder.
